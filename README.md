Weather App is a simple yet interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data powered by the OpenWeather API.
It provides real-time weather information for cities around the world.Users can search for a city by typing its name into the search bar and either clicking the search button or pressing "Enter." The app displays the current temperature, wind speed, and an appropriate weather icon representing the conditions, such as clouds, rain, or clear skies.
If the entered city is not found, a friendly error message is shown. With its clean design and responsive interface, the Weather App offers an engaging way to learn about integrating APIs and updating web content dynamically based on user input.
It is an excellent example of combining front-end development skills with API integration to create a practical and user-friendly tool.
